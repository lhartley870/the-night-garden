# The Night Garden
The Night Garden is a website for an outdoor restaurant serving evening meals in a garden setting based in Cardiff. 

Users that do not have an account with the site can view details about the restaurant on the Home page, the Menus page and the Contact page. They also have access to a registration page in order to create an account. Registered users can login to their account via the login page which gives them access to a 'My Bookings' page showing all of their bookings, from which they can edit or delete bookings. They also have access to a 'Make a Booking' page where they can make new restaurant bookings for up to 10 guests. 

The site's admin user can manage the restaurant tables and time slots for sittings. The admin decides which tables are made available for which time slots. The Admin user can also make bookings for users (this would be primarily for making large bookings of over 10 guests or for special events where the whole restaurant may be booked out for a user over several time slots). The Admin can also approve bookings for users. The booking system automatically checks whether there is capacity for a booking and books the best table configuration but the Admin has the final say over approving bookings e.g. if a user wants to book for 2 guests and they have been allocated an 8 person table by the booking system because that is the only available table for their chosen time slot, the Admin may not want to approve the booking.

## Restaurant Business Model
The restaurant is currently designed to have an intimate feel and so only holds a maximum of 32 guests at any one time. The restaurant has 2 hour 'sittings' at 5:30pm, 6pm, 7:30pm, 8pm, 9:30pm and 10pm.
